This was originally the work of Shihao Song:

https://github.com/Shihao-Song/DREXEL-DISCO-RISC-V-Simulator.

as an excercise for students in the ECEC 355 course: Computer Architecture taught by Dr. Anup K. Das
at Drexel University. The code by Shihao is the incomplete simulation of the single cycle computer architecture 
using RISC V ISA. 

We, Hanh Do Phung and Quang Anh Hoang, are working to complete the simulation. The repo is all the 
source codes needed but encoded with stegsnow to prevent plagiarism (since, we have just realized lately,
the fork cannot be made private). Howver, we have moved on to another private repo because we are tired of encoding
-decoding the files each push/pull we made.

It's all yours now, Have fun decoding!
